### Q1 — Where the CC0 pixel font comes from (blocks T1.20a) — open
- **Question:** GDD §9.1 and technical design §10 call for a CC0 pixel font for headings and the resource bar. Claude Code's sessions can't reach Kenney, OpenGameArt or similar sites, and npm has no CC0 pixel font. How should we get one?
- **Options:**
  (a) You download **Kenney Fonts** (kenney.nl/assets/kenney-fonts, CC0) and put the zip in `art-src/fonts/`. I pick one face, add it with a manifest entry, and credit it. It can ride along with the art pack list (T1.30).
  (b) I draw an original pixel font in-repo (digits, A–Z, a few symbols): CC0 by authorship, no download, but plainer.
  (c) Keep the system monospace stand-in until the v1.0 art pass.
- **Recommendation:** (a). Kenney's fonts are made for exactly this and are CC0. I'd fold it into the T1.30 pack list so you download once.
